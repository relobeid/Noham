### **Today:**
- What are my top 3 priorities?
- What support do I need?

### **Risks:**
- What could derail the timeline?
- What assumptions need validation?

---

## ðŸš¨ Risk Management

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **OpenAI API reliability** - Have fallback parsing
2. **GitHub API rate limits** - Implement proper caching
3. **Resume parsing accuracy** - Test with diverse formats
4. **User authentication security** - Follow best practices

### **Mitigation Strategies**
- Build in buffer time for each major component
- Test with real data early and often
- Have backup plans for external dependencies
- Focus on core features first, polish later
